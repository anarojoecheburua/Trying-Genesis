# 🚀 Genesis Simulation: Getting Started Guide 🧪🎥  

Welcome to my repository! This project showcases how to get started with the **Genesis AI Physics Engine** using a Jupyter Notebook. After some troubleshooting (and a lot of determination), I managed to set up Genesis in Google Colab and produce some outputs!  

## 📄 Overview  

This repository contains a step-by-step guide for:  
1. Setting up Genesis in a Google Colab environment.  
2. Creating a simple simulation scene with:  
   - A plane 🌐  
   - A box 📦  
   - A camera 🎥  
3. Rendering and saving simulation outputs.  

The notebook demonstrates how to navigate setup challenges and get Genesis running in an environment without direct display capabilities.  

## 📂 Files  

- `genesis_simulation.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and explanations.  
- Example outputs: Rendered images and videos (optional: if you include them).  

## 🚧 Challenges Faced  

Setting up Genesis wasn’t as straightforward as expected. Key issues included:  
1. Dependency conflicts 🤯  
2. Visualization in headless environments 💻  
3. GPU compatibility 🔧  

Thanks to Google Colab’s GPU support, I managed to overcome these challenges and produce successful outputs.  

## 🔧 Requirements  

- Python 3.7+ 🐍  
- Google Colab (recommended for GPU support) 🌐💻  
- Genesis AI Physics Engine 📦  
  - Install using:  
    ```bash
    pip install genesis-world
    ```
